# Project Zero Depricated Files

The files in this folder were once used for testing of API's and services.

## Files:

### NWS_API_Testing.ipynb

This makes calls to the NWS API to get station data. Testing URLS.

### ETL_Download_OLD.ipynb

This is a pipeline for the NOAA climate data API. It provides a rough structure to list and then download climate data from weather stations. This was replaced by the current ETL_Download.ipynb which was restructured to use a stack system to keep API calls running without error.
